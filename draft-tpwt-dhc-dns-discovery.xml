    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>As administrative domains are increasingly outsourcing their DNS, it is recommended that DNS requests no longer be sent in an unencrypted message. DNS over TLS is a common form of providing privacy to DNS but DTLS may also be supported. In order to use encrypted forms of DNS securely, more information is needed by the client than simply the IP address.</t>
