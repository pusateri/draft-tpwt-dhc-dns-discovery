# draft-tpwt-dhc-dns-discovery
DHCPv6 Options for private DNS Discovery

This draft is an individual submission for the DHC Working Group of the IETF.

## Status

After some good discussions at the DRIU BOF at the IETF 102 in Montr√©al,
we have decided to terminate this work.

Ted Lemon made a good argument that DHCP should only be used for boostrapping
initial network parameters and not for full fledged configuration of all
network parameters.

There was enough consensus that we feel that moving forward with this work
would go against the wishes of the IETF community.

There still is a need for configuring the ADN in a campus environment
where all of the servers are controlled by the network administrator but
a different proposal will need to be invented.
